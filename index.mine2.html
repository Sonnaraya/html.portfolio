<hr />
<h3>The 100</h3>
<p>Set 97 years after a nuclear war destroyed civilization, when a spaceship housing humanity's lone survivors sends 100 juvenile delinquents back to Earth, hoping to repopulate the planet.</p>
<p>That wa my first series I've ever watched, I started watching this when I was 13 years old</p>
<h3>The Witcher</h3>
<p>Geralt of Rivia, a solitary monster hunter, struggles to find his place in a world where people often prove more wicked than beasts.</p>
<p>It its a film adaptation of my favorite game</p>
<h3>Altered Carbon</h3>
<p>Set in a future where consciousness is digitized and stored, a prisoner returns to life in a new body and must solve a mind-bending murder to win his freedom.</p>
<p>Very absorbing series, a lot of things is happening in this movie</p>
