<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My namie is Karolina I was born and raised in Poland in a small village. I am 22 years old. I graduated school as nutrionist.
</p>

<p>After I finished school I moved to Amsterdam and I was working there for almost two years.
  My last job was in a DSV vompany as a troubleshooter but I could feel that is not my path in life.
I had an opportnuity to be part of the courde "Umiejętności Jutra". It is a course about digital marketing created in cooperation with Google and Main Business School in Warsaw.
</p>

<p>During my adventure with this course I felt that I am missing something and I started a cours 'web development' with Angela Yu and I realize that It is giving me more fun than I expected.</p>
